// E1: Write a program that has a variable called radius as the first line which is a number and outputs three numbers:
// - The circumference of the circle
// - The area of the circle
// - The area of an isoceles triangle sitting inside the upper half of the circle.
// Output the result in a nicely formatted text.
// Think of the unit you want to use
