# A tiny bit of magic

`> npm init`

Just press Enter until all questions are asked and answered

This creates a package.json file that describes your new nodejs project

`> npm install prompt-sync`

This installs a package called "prompt-sync" and makes it available to us in nodejs programs

## Troubleshooting

- Is nodejs installed? 
- Does it work in VSCode?
- Do you have working internet?
