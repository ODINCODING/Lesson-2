// Create a variable (a box for "something") called myName and assign it the String value "Jan"
// Strings can be in either "double" or 'single' quotes, doesn't really matter

let myName = "Jan";

// variables can be of various types. A String is a bunch of characters or as we call it: Text.
// A Number in JavaScript can be an integer or a floating point number.
let myAge = 46;
let pi = 3.14; // good enough

// You can assign and reassign variables. On reassignment you leave out the let.

let myAge = 35; // My imaginary age
myAge = 46; // My real age
